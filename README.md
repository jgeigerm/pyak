Pyak
====

A Python wrapper for Yik Yak's API, which is currently out of date. I may or may not be bringing this project back to life, since Yik Yak's API has changed significantly since josephc346 last finished this, and quite a bit of reverse engineering work would have to be done to get this in a usable state.
